5. So you can save the modifications, and now your bot has the Blip Desk Scheduler plugin.

## üíªUsage
To use the plugin, you need to click more options (three points icon) on the top menu and select Blip Desk Scheduler, so you will go to the scheduler panel, 
to configure the times work and days off in your attendiment. In the end, click **"Save"**. 

When you click "save", the plugin will generate in the bot resources a "workTime" variable that you can use to handle the attendiment work time. 

### workTime variable:
```
{
    "weekdays": [
        {
            "day": "day name",
            "workTimes": [
                {
                    "start": "hh:mm",
                    "end": "hh:mm"
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ],
    "noWorkDays": [
        "dd-MM",
        ...
    ],
    "schedulerMessage": "scheduler message"
}
```
**TIPS:** You can use the "schedulerMessage" variable to get a message to show in a block.
